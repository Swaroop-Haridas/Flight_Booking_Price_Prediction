# Flight_Booking_Price_Prediction

This document delves into the prediction of flight booking prices, encompassing essential components such as data loading and exploration, data visualization, data description, modeling, and evaluation. The dataset, named Flight_Booking.csv, includes attributes such as airline, flight details, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, stops, class, duration, days left until departure, and price. Initially, the data is loaded using Pandas' pd.read_csv() function, followed by an examination of the first few rows via df.head(). Subsequently, the dataset's dimensions and data types are determined using df.shape and df.info() functions respectively, providing insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics. 
Although devoid of specific modeling or evaluation steps, the file imports common machine learning libraries such as sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, and sklearn.ensemble. The dataset appears comprehensive, suitable for various machine learning tasks such as flight price prediction, demand estimation, or flight schedule optimization. It serves as an initial resource for further exploration and development of flight booking prediction models.
